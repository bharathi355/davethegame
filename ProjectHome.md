Dave is just your average nerd. In his dream he is a Ninja, a Wizard, a Superhero, or a mighty Barbarian. Once he cannot wake up from his dreams, he must save himself by battle his own dreams.

DTBNWS is a sidescrolling beat'em up with RPG elements, developed using XNA.


The game is developed as a means of self-teaching, and is currently in planning stages. We will be uploading concept art, design documents (these will be probably in hungarian, as we are from Hungary). The game will be finished, when its finished :)
